# Tools / Modules (The portal only needs to list them, but we want to avoid 
# huge analytical libraries being scanned or included in the function bundle)
# We can ignore the tool code itself if we want to be very safe,
# but since the Flask app walks these directories to find tool names,
# we keep the directory but ignore large files.
