## 👋 Introduction
Welcome to Snaphire! This guide will help you navigate the platform and use the various analytical tools to manage your e-commerce operations.

## 🔐 Getting Started
1. **Access the Portal**: Open your web browser and go to the provided URL (typically `http://localhost:5000` or a custom company link).
2. **Login**: Enter your username and password provided by your administrator.
3. **Change Password**: We recommend changing your password after the first login for security.

## 🧭 Navigating the Portal
The portal is designed for simplicity:
- **Sidebar**: Use the sidebar on the left to select the business module you want to work with (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart, or Reconciliation).
- **Tool Tabs**: Once a module is selected, you will see several tabs at the top. Each tab represents a specific analytical tool or report.

## 🛠️ Using the Tools
Most tools follow a simple 3-step process:

### 1. Upload Data
Click the **"Browse Files"** button or drag and drop your CSV/Excel files into the upload area. 
> [!TIP]
> Ensure your files are exported directly from the Amazon/Flipkart seller portals for the best results.

### 2. Process & Analyze
Once the file is uploaded, the tool will automatically process the data. You will see interactive tables, charts, and summaries appearing on the screen.

### 3. Download Results
After the analysis is complete, look for a **"Download Report"** button (usually at the bottom or top of the results). You can download the processed data back into Excel or CSV format for your records.
